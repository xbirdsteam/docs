## 1. What Actions Consume Credits?

Credits are required for the following actions:

- **Generating Test Scenarios**
- **Generating Test Cases**
- **Update with Changes** (adjusting test scenarios or cases based on change requests)
- **Update Test Case** (editing existing test cases based on change request)
- **Rebuild Scenarios** (regenerating test scenarios from scratch)
- **Clone Test Scenarios** (duplicating scenarios for a new version)
- **Translate** into another language

Each of these tasks consumes a certain number of credits, depending on the complexity and size of the request.

## 2. Credits Allocation and Expiry

- **Credits are issued monthly** according to your subscription plan.
- **Credits do not roll over** to the next month. Any unused credits will expire at the end of the billing cycle (reset every month).
- **Additional credits purchased** are only valid for the **current plan** in which they were bought.
- **Free plan:** Users receive 50,000 credits which do not expire until they are used up or until you upgrade to a paid plan.

## 3. Purchasing Additional Credits

- Users on **STARTER, PREMIUM, and MAX** plans can purchase extra credits if their monthly allocation runs out.
- Purchased credits are **only valid for the current month plan** and will not carry over to the next billing cycle.

## 4. How Are Credits Calculated?

The number of credits consumed by each action is based on the **complexity of your request**:

- **More complex tasks consume more credits.**\
  For example:
  - Uploading files or images, or working with features that have many scenarios, will require more credits.
  - Generating test cases is typically more resource-intensive than generating test scenarios, since it involves more detailed analysis and longer AI responses.
- **Simple tasks cost fewer credits**, while tasks with large data, many scenarios, or complex logic will require more.

## 5. Summary

- Credits are essential for using TestGenAIâ€™s AI features.
- Your monthly credits reset at the start of each new billing cycle.
- Additional purchased credits will expire at the end of the current monthly billing cycle, regardless of your overall plan duration.
- To optimize your usage, plan your AI tasks according to your monthly credit allocation and consider purchasing more if needed.
