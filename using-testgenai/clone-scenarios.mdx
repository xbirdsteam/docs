## 1. How to Use Clone Checklist

1. On the feature details page, click the **three dots ("...")** menu located between the download and settings icons.

   <img
     src="/images/more-feature-2.png"
     alt="More Feature 2 Pn"
     title="More Feature 2 Pn"
     style={{ width:"48%" }}
   />
2. In the dropdown, select the **Clone Checklist** option.
3. Click the **Run** button next to this option.

## 2. What Happens When You Clone?

- The system creates a **new version** of your feature.
- All current **test cases are removed**; only the checklist are kept in the new version.
- This gives you a fresh starting point to generate new test cases or make further adjustments to your checklist.

## 3. Timeline Integration

- After cloning, an entry will appear in the **Timeline** tab showing that the checklist were cloned, indicating the source version and the newly created version.

  <img
    src="/images/clone-timeline.jpg"
    alt="Clone Timeline Jp"
    title="Clone Timeline Jp"
    style={{ width:"61%" }}
  />

<Note>
  **Note:**

  - Cloning does **not** affect your existing versions â€” all previous test cases and checklist are preserved.
  - You can always return to any prior version using the Version dropdown or Timeline.
