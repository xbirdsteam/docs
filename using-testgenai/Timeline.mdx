## 1. How to Access the Timeline

1. On the feature details page, click the **Expand Sidebar** icon (`<<`) on the right side of the screen.

   <img
     src="/images/expand-rightsidebar.png"
     alt="Expand Rightsidebar Pn"
     title="Expand Rightsidebar Pn"
     style={{ width:"42%" }}
   />
2. In the sidebar, select the **Timeline** tab.

   <img
     src="/images/timeline2.jpg"
     alt="Timeline2 Jp"
     title="Timeline2 Jp"
     style={{ width:"51%" }}
   />

## 2. What the Timeline Shows

The Timeline displays a chronological list of all key actions and changes related to the feature, including:

- **Feature creation and initial scenario generation**\
  When a new feature is created and its first batch of test scenarios (checklist) is generated.
- **Generate Test scenarios**

  When user requests to generate Test scenarios
- **Update with changes requests**\
  All user requests to adjust, add, remove, merge, or split test scenarios via the "Update with changes" workflow.
- **Test cases generation**\
  Each time test cases are generated (all at once, by category/sub-category, or individually).
- **Continue generating test cases**\
  Events when you use the "Continue" button to finish generating pending test cases after an update.
- **Update test case requests**\
  Any time you submit a request to update an individual test case.
- **Rebuild test scenarios**\
  When the scenario structure is rebuilt, usually after a major requirement or structural change.
- **Clone test scenarios**\
  Actions where you duplicate scenarios for reuse or modification.
- **Translate test cases**\
  When you translate test cases into different languages, including which language and which version.

Each entry in the timeline includes a timestamp, a summary of the action, and often a “View” link to see the version as it was at that point.
