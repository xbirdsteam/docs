    Create a project to manage features & test cases
  </Card>
  <Card title="Modules" icon="folder" href="/using-testgenai/CreatingModules">
    Create the folder to manage epic or multiple features
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### 2. Open the Test Case Generator

- In the sidebar, click **\+ New Test Cases** to open the test case creation screen.

### 3. Input Feature Requirements

### 4. Click "Create TCs"

- Optionally, select the language for your test cases if prompted.
- Click the **Create TCs** button to let AI process your requirements and propose test scenarios.

### 5. Review the Test Scenarios

- AI will generate a **test scenario** of all potential test cases (test scenarios) based on your requirements.
- The **test scenarios** is grouped by categories, sub-category and priorities (Critical, High, Medium, Low).

### 6. Refine the Test Scenarios (Optional)

- You can **comment, add, remove, or adjust** any **test scenario** item.
- Once done, click **Update with changes** to re-sync the **test scenarios** with your adjustments.

### 7. Generate Test Cases

You have flexible options for generating test cases:

- **Generate All TCs:** Create test cases for every test scenarios item at once.
- **Generate TCs** by category or sub-category.
- **Generate TC** for a single test scenario item.

#### Test Case Settings Popup

On the **first** **generate action** or clicking on **Setting** icon, you’ll see a popup to configure:

- **Test Case ID Prefix:** Set how your test cases are numbered (e.g. LEAD001).
- **Test Data Example:** Optionally provide test data. This will be sent to AI with each generation or update.

![Tcs Settings Jp](/images/tcs-settings.jpg)

You can update these **settings** anytime. Test data will be included each time you generate or update test cases.

### 8. Update Test Case

You have flexible requesting to regenerat test case with comment

<Card title="Update Testcase" icon="sliders" href="/using-testgenai/UpdateTestCase">
  Comment and request to regenerate a test case
</Card>

### 9. View Test Case Generation History

- You can view all history of changes: test scenarios creation, test casesgeneration, additions, removals, translations, etc.

  <Card title="Timeline" icon="timeline" href="/using-testgenai/Timeline">
    View all history of changes
  </Card>
  <Card title="Versions" icon="code-branch" href="/using-testgenai/Versions">
    View versions of testcase
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### 10. Table View & Filtering

- Switch to **Table View** to view test cases in a grid, making it easy to search, filter, and review details.
- Filter by priority, category, sub-category, or search by keyword.

![Table View Jp](/images/table-view.jpg)

### 11. Continue Generation

- If not all test cases have been generated for a feature, click **Continue** to let the AI finish generating any remaining test cases.

## Notes

- You can always return to refine requirements, add new files, or update the test scenarios.
- AI-generated test cases are customizable—review and adjust as needed for your team’s standards.
- The process supports both high-level scenario generation and detailed, step-by-step test cases.

<Tip>
  **TIPS**

  - The more detailed and clear your requirements, the higher the quality of generated test cases.
  - Use images and files for complex flows or UI requirements.
  - Leverage the Table View for bulk management and review of large test case sets.
