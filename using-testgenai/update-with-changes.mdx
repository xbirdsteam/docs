## 1. How “Update with changes” Works

- You review the generated Test Scenarios.
- You can **comment** to request additions, removals, splits, merges, or other edits.
- All your changes and comments appear in the **right sidebar** under the **Changes** tab.
- When ready, click **Update with changes**:\
  AI will process your feedback and update the Test Scenarios accordingly. The new version of test cases will be created.

<Tip>
  **Important:**

  - Test Cases (TCs) already generated for unchanged Test Scenarios will be kept, even if their order or priority changes.
  - For new, changed, scenarios, you can generate new TCs as needed using “Continue” or generate individual TCs.

## 4. Reviewing Change History

<Note>
  **Tips:**

  - Use comments for precise requests (e.g., “split this into 3 scenarios for each user role”).
  - Use merge when scenarios are too detailed or duplicate.
  - Attach screenshots or specs for complex changes.
  - Always review the Timeline to ensure your requirements were correctly applied.
