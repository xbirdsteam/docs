## 1. How to Use the Version Feature

### 1.1. Viewing and Switching Versions

- On the feature details page, use the **Version dropdown** at the top left to switch between available versions.
- When you select a version, the page will update to show the Test cases as they existed in that version.

  title="Versions Jp"
  style={{ width:"63%" }}
/>

### 1.2. Viewing Versions from the Timeline

- In the **Timeline** tab of the right sidebar, each major action (such as updates, translations, or test case generation) is linked to a specific version.
- Click the **View** button next to any version entry to instantly see the scenarios and test cases for that version.

## 2. When are Versions Created?

A new version is automatically created whenever you:

- Use **Update with changes** to adjust the Test scenarios.
- Rebuild or clone test scenarios.
- Translate test cases into another language (each translation is linked to a version).
- Make other major structural changes.

They will not change when you expand test scenarios to test cases or update a single test case.
