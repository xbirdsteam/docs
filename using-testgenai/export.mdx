  - In **Card View**: Click the **Export** icon to export all, or use **Multiselect** to pick specific cases, then export only your selections.
- **ID Configuration:**
  - **Keep original IDs (as selected):**\

    Assign new IDs to exported cases, starting from your chosen prefix and number. For example, if you select prefix "AB", start from 5 and export three cases, their IDs will be AB005, AB006, AB007 (regardless of the original IDs).
