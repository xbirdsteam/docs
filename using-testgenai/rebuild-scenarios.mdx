title: "Rebuild Checklist"
description: "The Rebuild Checklist feature allows you to generate a completely new set of Checklist for a feature, based on the original requirements. This process ignores all current Checklist and test cases, essentially giving you a “fresh start” while preserving previous versions for reference."

## 1. How to Use Rebuild Checklist

1. On the feature details page, click the **three dots ("...")** menu located between the download and settings icons.

   <img
     src="/images/more-feature-2.png"
     alt="More Feature 2 Pn"
     title="More Feature 2 Pn"
     style={{ width:"51%" }}
   />
2. In the dropdown, find the **Rebuild Checklist** option.
3. Click the **Run** button next to this option.

## 2. What Happens When You Rebuild?

- The system will send your feature and project information to the AI engine.
- The AI will analyze your original requirements and **create an entirely new set of checklist**, ignoring any existing checklist or test cases.
- After completion, a **new version** is automatically created containing only the newly generated checklist.
- Your previous versions remain fully accessible for reference or rollback.

## 3. Timeline Integration

- After the rebuild is done, an entry will appear in the **Timeline** tab showing that the checklist have been rebuilt for this feature, including a summary of the generated checklist and any related attachments or screenshots.

  <img
    src="/images/rebuild-test-scenarios.jpg"
    alt="Rebuild Test Scenarios Jp"
    title="Rebuild Test Scenarios Jp"
    style={{ width:"51%" }}
  />

<Note>
  **Note:**

  - Use this feature if requirements have changed significantly, or if you want to start over with a new checklist structure.
  - The system ensures older versions are kept safe, so you can always compare or revert if needed.
