## 2. What Happens Next?

- The AI will analyze your request and update the selected test case according to your instructions.
- The updated test case will **replace** the previous test case.
- **Only the selected test case is changed**; this action does **not** create a new version of the overall checklist or scenario.

## 3. Change History

- Every update to a test case is recorded in the **Timeline** tab, so you can always review what changes were made, when, and by whom.

  Tips:

  - Use this feature to update an individual test case at any time, regardless of project or scenario version.
  - Be specific in your request to ensure the updated test case meets your expectations.
  - For batch updates or changes to the checklist structure, use "Update with changes" at the scenario level.
