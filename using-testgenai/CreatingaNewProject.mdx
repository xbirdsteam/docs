### 2.2. Advanced Settings

Expand **Advanced Settings** to configure how AI generates your test cases. If you do not configure these settings, the default configuration will be used.

#### a. Writing Style & Tone

- Define the writing style, tone, and language for your test cases.
- Use templates, default, or specify your own preferences.

#### b. Test Coverage Strategy

- Specify which types of testing to cover (e.g., UI Testing, Functional Testing, Data Validation).
- Use templates or write a custom strategy.

#### c. Priority Levels

Set criteria for four priority levels:

- **Critical Priority**: What makes a test case critical?
- **High Priority**
- **Medium Priority**
- **Low Priority**

For each level, describe when a test case should be assigned that priority.

#### d. Exclusion Rules

- Define what should **not** be tested (features to skip, scenarios to exclude, etc.).
- AI will avoid generating test cases for these.

#### e. Test Steps Detail Level

- Specify how detailed the test steps should be (high-level steps or fine-grained instructions).

Once all required and any desired optional fields are complete, click **Create** to add your new project.

## 3. Viewing and Managing Projects

- Click **View all Projects** in the sidebar to see all your projects.
- For each project card, click the three-dot menu (**...**) to:
  - **Rename** the project
  - Access **Settings** to edit configurations at any time
  - **Delete Project** if no longer needed

You can always revisit and edit your project’s settings to adapt as your requirements evolve.

> **Tip:**\
> Customize advanced settings for the best AI-generated test cases. You can update project settings anytime.

<Warning>
  **Impact Notice**

  The updated settings will only apply to new features created after this change

  When regenerating existing features, new settings will apply, but previous test cases will remain unchanged
</Warning>
