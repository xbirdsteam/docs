## 1. How to Use the Translate Feature

1. On the feature details page, click the **three dots ("...")** menu located between the download and settings icons.

     src="/images/more-features.jpg"
     alt="More Features Jp"
     title="More Features Jp"
     style={{ width:"60%" }}
   />
2. In the dropdown, find the **Translate** section.
3. Select the target language you want to translate your test cases into using the language dropdown.
4. Click the **Run** button to start the translation.

## 2. How Translation Works

- The application sends your translation request to the AI engine.
- The AI will translate all current test cases and/or test scenarios into the selected language.
  - If your current version only has test scenarios, only those will be translated.
  - If your current version includes both test scenarios and test cases, both will be translated.
- After the translation is complete:
  - A **new version** is automatically created with the translated content.
  - The Timeline will show an entry indicating that your test cases have been translated into the new language.

## 3. Reviewing Translated Versions

- You can switch to the new version using the **Version** dropdown or from the **Timeline** tab.
- Timeline entries will clearly indicate when and which version was translated, along with the language.

  title="Translate Version Pn"
  style={{ width:"55%" }}

<Note>
  **NOTE:**

  - The translation applies to the current content of your feature. Make sure you are on the correct version before running translation.
  - Each translation creates a new version, so your original content is always preserved.
</Note>

## 4. Compare versions

You can compare the test cases version of original language and the translated language by using **compare version** feature. This feature will be developed soon.
